  <h2>Basic Example</h2>
  <p>Cards are built with as little markup and styles as possible, but still manage to deliver a ton of control and customization. Built with flexbox, they offer easy alignment and mix well with other Bootstrap components. They have no <code class="highlighter-rouge">margin</code> by default, so use <a href="/docs/4.4/utilities/spacing/">spacing utilities</a> as needed.</p>
  <p>Below is an example of a basic card with mixed content and a fixed width. Cards have no fixed width to start, so theyâ€™ll naturally fill the full width of its parent element. This is easily customized with our various <a href="#sizing">sizing options</a>.</p>

  <div class="padding-top">
    <div class="card" style="width: 18rem;">
      <img src="./../../../img/default.jpg" class="card-img-top" alt="...">
      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title">Card title</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Some quick example text to build on the card title and make up the bulk of the card's content.</p>
        <a href="#" class="btn btn-primary">Go somewhere</a>
