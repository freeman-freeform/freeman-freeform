        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>We use a large block of connected links for our pagination, making links hard to miss and easily scalable—all while providing large hit areas. Pagination is built with list HTML elements so screen readers can announce the number of available links. Use a wrapping <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code> element to identify it as a navigation section to screen readers and other assistive technologies.</p>
        <p>In addition, as pages likely have more than one such navigation section, it’s advisable to provide a descriptive <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-label</code> for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;nav&gt;</code> to reflect its purpose. For example, if the pagination component is used to navigate between a set of search results, an appropriate label could be <code class="highlighter-rouge">aria-label="Search results pages"</code>.</p>
