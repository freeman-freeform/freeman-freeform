<div class="padding">
    <h2>Enable popovers</h2>
    <p>One way to initialize all popovers on a page would be to select them by their <code class="highlighter-rouge">data-toggle</code> attribute</p>

    <button type="button" class="btn btn-lg btn-danger" data-toggle="popover" title="Popover title" data-content="And here's some amazing content. It's very engaging. Right?">Click to toggle popover</button>
</div>
